## üìå Problem Statement

**Problem Statement 3 ‚Äì Real-Time Data Experiences with Fluvio**

---

## üéØ Objective

Modern agriculture faces challenges in maintaining optimal environmental conditions for crops, especially in controlled environments like greenhouses. This project solves that problem by simulating a smart greenhouse that:

- Monitors real-time sensor data like temperature, humidity, CO2, and more.
- Controls key devices such as fans, lights, humidifiers, and water pumps.
- Provides a visually rich dashboard for interaction.

It enables farmers and greenhouse managers to remotely monitor and control their greenhouse, ensuring healthier plants and better yields.

## üß† Team & Approach

### Team Name:  
`SoloBloom`

### Team Member:  
- Aanand Pandit ([GitHub](https://github.com/aanandpandit) / Developer / Solo Performer)

### My Approach:  
- Chose this problem for its real-world impact in agriculture automation.
- Built a simulation to model a greenhouse using PyQt5 and Flask.
- Integrated Fluvio for real-time, low-latency communication between UI and backend.
- Focused on simplicity, extensibility, and live visual feedback for a robust experience.
