## üìå Problem Statement

**Problem Statement 3 ‚Äì Real-Time Data Experiences with Fluvio**

---

## üéØ Objective

Modern agriculture faces challenges in maintaining optimal environmental conditions for crops, especially in controlled environments like greenhouses. This project solves that problem by simulating a smart greenhouse that:

- Monitors real-time sensor data like temperature, humidity, CO2, and more.
- Controls key devices such as fans, lights, humidifiers, and water pumps.
- Provides a visually rich dashboard for interaction.

It enables farmers and greenhouse managers to remotely monitor and control their greenhouse, ensuring healthier plants and better yields.

### Local Setup:
```bash
1. Clone the Repository:
    ‚Äògit clone https://github.com/AanandPandit/hackhazards25_green-house-agri-farming.git‚Äô
    cd hackhazards25_green-house-agri-farming

2. Install Fluvio Client:
    sudo curl -fsS https://hub.infinyon.cloud/install/install.sh | bash

    (After installing run this command to add path to system environment:)
    echo 'export PATH="${HOME}/.fvm/bin:${HOME}/.fluvio/bin:${PATH}"' >> ~/.zshrc

    (Reboot the system to take effect on changes of installation.)
    sudo reboot 

3. Login to InfinyOn Cloud:
    fluvio cloud login
    (Enter your InfinyOn Cloud email and password when prompted.)

4. Create and Setup the Cluster:
    # Create cluster
    fluvio cloud cluster create greenhouse-agri
       
    # Check available clusters
    fluvio profile list        
     
    # Set cluster for use                  
    fluvio profile switch greenhouse-agri 

    # Check the current cluster       
    fluvio profile                                    

5. Create Fluvio Topics:
    fluvio topic create dht-temp

## üèÅ Final Words

HackHazards‚Äô25 was an amazing journey! I learned a lot about real-time data streaming using Fluvio, UI design, and IoT system simulation while building the Smart Greenhouse Dashboard.

From syncing devices to handling offline modes, every challenge taught me something new. The best part? Watching everything work together in real time ‚Äî sensors, controls, and the dashboard.

Huge thanks to the organizers and the open-source community for the inspiration. This is just the beginning ‚Äî the future of smart farming is here! üå±
